// Dev utility: seeds a variety of notes, todos, and contacts into a
// context so the UI and MCP tools have real data to work against.
//
// Idempotent: every seeded row carries the `seed:dev` tag (notes) or
// the "[seed-dev]" name prefix (contacts/todos). Re-running is a no-op
// when the sentinel is already present — counts report the pre-existing
// state rather than re-inserting.
//
// Usage:
//   dotnet run --project tools/seed-dev-data -- \
//       [--data <path>] \
//       [--user <id>] \
//       [--context user|team] [--context-id <slug>] \
//       [--force]              (reseed even if sentinels already exist)
//
// Defaults:
//   --data fishbowl-data             (matches Fishbowl.Host's default)
//   --user <first user in system.db>
//   --context user                   (--context-id required when team)

// ────────── Notes ──────────
//
// A corpus big enough to stress-test hybrid search. Notes are grouped by
// topic so re-reading the source gives a map of the search probes:
//
//   * SEMANTIC-WIN probes — pairs where the query wording doesn't overlap
//     the note wording, so the embedding has to carry the match.
//   * LEXICAL-WIN probes — notes full of specific identifiers (error codes,
//     product SKUs, function names) that FTS5 prefix-match nails and the
//     embedding smears.
//   * PARAPHRASE TWINS — two notes about the same concept using different
//     vocabulary; ranking should surface both for either phrasing.
//
// All notes share the seed:dev sentinel tag. A handful also carry
// review:pending so the `includePending` filter on /api/v1/search has
// something to flip between.
//
// Embedding reminder: this tool writes notes WITHOUT embeddings (the
// repo's IEmbeddingService dep is left null). Run `tools/reindex-dev`
// afterwards to populate vec_notes — otherwise search degrades to FTS-only.
